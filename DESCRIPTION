Description: Iteratively Adjusted Surrogate Variable Analysis (IA-SVA) is a
    statistical framework to uncover hidden sources of variation even when these
    sources are correlated. IA-SVA provides a flexible methodology to i) identify a
    hidden factor for unwanted heterogeneity while adjusting for all known factors;
    ii) test the significance of the putative hidden factor for explaining the
    unmodeled variation in the data; and iii), if significant, use the estimated factor as an
    additional known factor in the next iteration to uncover further hidden factors.
